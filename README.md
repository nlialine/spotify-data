Project: Analyzing my Spotify Data with R

Spotify allows you to request a copy of your personal data, which consists of your playlists, library, and listening history. These come to you in a .zip file containing several JSON files.

Using the "spotifyr" package, I can get more data about my songs and my favorite artists through the Spotify API.

Will be updated more with the other packages I used.
